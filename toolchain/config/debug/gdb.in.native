      In case you have trouble with dynamic loading of shared libraries,
      you will find that a static gdb comes in handy.

      However, it has been noticed at least on x86 that enabling this
      option produces an invalid gdb binary. It is linked with
      "-static -Wl,--dynamic-list=..." which
      # (a) requests invalid program interpreter
      # (b) crashes glibc/uClibc-ng and does not work with musl
      # See https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2017-03/msg00267.html

      It is possible it would work with other architectures, hence it is
      not completely removed. Use with care and report to the mailing list
      if the resulting gdbserver works.
